 The idea for this type of mock was presented in WWDC 2018 and is more than likely how frameworks like `Moya` handle mocking data for network calls. This class of type `URLProtocol`. `URLProtocol`s are used on `URLSession`s to tell the session how to handle a given `URLRequest`. By mocking this part of the network call you can choose what data to send back to the calling function. The alternative of using this for unit tests would be injecting data into either a view model or the controller directly. That "works" but doesn't prevent the network call from happening at all. This mock will stop all network calls and _only_ return data. Basically, this mock allows you to test your network layer directly in a production setting instead of testing viewmodel data injects.
